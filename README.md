# VenomAttack-toolchains

The repository is divided two parts: activity generation and the source code of EasyNote.

# Activity Generation
The activity generation is used to generate fake activities, including background image, xml file and java file.
The user only need to set some parameters related to saved files.

# EasyNote
Three parts contained in the folder: java source code, source files and AndroidManifest file.
The user only need to put the three part into a Android Studio project, and build the project.

Before build the proejct, the project need to access to the hotpatch framework, [Tinker](https://github.com/Tencent/tinker)
Follow the Tinker framework configuration tutorial directly to succeed.

Besides, some parameters need to be set: the ip of the remote server, the port used to connect to the server, the background image generated by the activity generation engine and the timing choosing code.
The timing choosing code(i.e., the exploit of the bug and the flaw, more details are shown in our manuscript) will be released when the bug and flow are fixed by the vendors.
