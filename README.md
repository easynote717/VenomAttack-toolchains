The repository is divided two parts: activity generation and the source code of EasyNote.

Specifically, the activity generation is used to generate fake activities, including background image, xml file and java file.
The user only need to set some parameters related to saved files.
For the EasyNote, the user can built the project by Android Studio directly.
